            THE GAZING GLOBE BY EUGENE PILLOT</h5>
        
           <h6>ZAMA.</h6> <p> [_In a chiding, motherly way._] </p>  <p>Ohano, my child, you must not be
            so much at that evil ball! How many times be I not telling you it is an
            _enchanted_ ball? </p><br>
            
           <h6>OHANO.</h6>  <p> Yes, Zama, I hope it is enchanted. I've tried every other means
            to gain the way to my heart's desire--and they've all failed me. The
            story these islanders have woven round this gazing globe may be but a
            myth--but if it shows me the way to my freedom, I shall not have looked
            at it in vain. </p> <br>
            
            <h6>ZAMA.</h6> <p> Be you forgetting, child, 'tis said that evil ball shows only the
            way to destruction! </p> <br>
            
            <h6> OHANO.</h6> <p> Yes, these island people will create any myth, go any length, to
            keep one thinking, living in their narrow way. You are destined for evil
            if you try to follow the urge of your own heart--oh, yes, I know.</p><br>
            
            <h6>ZAMA.</h6> <p>But _your_ heart, child, should only be wanting the love of Nijo.</p> <br>
            
            <h6>OHANO.</h6> <p> Nijo--I am hoping that he will be big enough to help me--but my
            lover has been away so long---- </p> <br>
            
            <h6>ZAMA.</h6> <p>But to-day he be coming back--I came to tell you I think I saw his
            boat---- </p> <br>
